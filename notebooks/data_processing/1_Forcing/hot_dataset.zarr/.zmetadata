All samples were collected through the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) program, which began in 1988 with ~monthly cruises to Station ALOHA (A Long-term Oligotrophic Habitat Assessment; 22\u00c2\u00b0 10 N, 158\u00c2\u00b0 00 W). Photosynthetic production of organic matter was measured by the 14C tracer method. Details on the methods employed over the years are detailed in Karl et al., Progress in Oceanography ([https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2021.102563](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2021.102563)). Flow cytometry-based determinations of microbial abundances were made using an EPICS 753 flow cytometer on HOT 22-173 (December 1980 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 September 2005) and a B/D Influx flow cytometer beginning with HOT 174 . Details on the flow cytometry methods are provided at [https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/bact.html](https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/bact.html). Samples for chlorophyll a and phaeopigments were collected onto Whatman GF/F filters and extracted with 100% acetone and measured on a Turner Designs Model 10-AU fluorometer based on standard techniques described in Strickland and Parsons, 1972. Method details available at [https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/chl.html](https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/chl.html). Time is in a separate column from date.

            "dataset_description": "\u00e2\u0080\u009cLarge zooplankton and micronekton play important roles in the export of organic material from surface waters in the open ocean. Global Ocean Flux planning models suggest that the relationship between primary production and passive particulate export flux is strongly influenced by size structure of the zooplankton community (e.g., Paffenh\u00c3\u00b6ffer & Knowles, 1979; Small et al., 1987; Frost, 1984). Active vertical migrations also have important implications for the transport and transformation of surface-derived organic particulates to dissolved inorganic constituents at depth (Longhurst & Harrison, 1988; Longhurst et al., 1990; Al-Mutairi & Landry, 2001; Hannides et al., 2008). The zooplankton component of the time-series sampling effort allows such processes to be considered in the interpretation of seasonal and interannual variations in measured flux and the elemental mass balance (e.g., carbon and nitrogen sources and sinks) of the euphotic zone. At Station ALOHA, 6 net tows are scheduled per cruise. Three midnight (2200 - 0200) and 3 mid-day (1000 - 1400) oblique tows are done using a 1-m2 net (3-m length) with 202-\u00c2\u00b5m mesh Nitex netting. The net is towed obliquely at approximately 1 knot, from the surface to approximately 175 m and then back to the surface. Towing time is approximately 20-30 minutes. The tows are subsequently size-fractioned and analyzed for mesozooplankton wet and dry weight and C and N biomass.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rows with no depth value have been removed. Time is in local time (HST). [https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/plankton.html](https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/plankton.html)",

            "dataset_description": "\u00e2\u0080\u009cLarge zooplankton and micronekton play important roles in the export of organic material from surface waters in the open ocean. Global Ocean Flux planning models suggest that the relationship between primary production and passive particulate export flux is strongly influenced by size structure of the zooplankton community (e.g., Paffenh\u00c3\u00b6ffer & Knowles, 1979; Small et al., 1987; Frost, 1984). Active vertical migrations also have important implications for the transport and transformation of surface-derived organic particulates to dissolved inorganic constituents at depth (Longhurst & Harrison, 1988; Longhurst et al., 1990; Al-Mutairi & Landry, 2001; Hannides et al., 2008). The zooplankton component of the time-series sampling effort allows such processes to be considered in the interpretation of seasonal and interannual variations in measured flux and the elemental mass balance (e.g., carbon and nitrogen sources and sinks) of the euphotic zone. At Station ALOHA, 6 net tows are scheduled per cruise. Three midnight (2200 - 0200) and 3 mid-day (1000 - 1400) oblique tows are done using a 1-m2 net (3-m length) with 202-\u00c2\u00b5m mesh Nitex netting. The net is towed obliquely at approximately 1 knot, from the surface to approximately 175 m and then back to the surface. Towing time is approximately 20-30 minutes. The tows are subsequently size-fractioned and analyzed for mesozooplankton wet and dry weight and C and N biomass.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rows with no depth value have been removed. Time is in local time (HST). [https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/plankton.html](https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/plankton.html)",

All samples were collected through the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) program, which began in 1988 with ~monthly cruises to Station ALOHA (A Long-term Oligotrophic Habitat Assessment; 22\u00c2\u00b0 10 N, 158\u00c2\u00b0 00 W). Photosynthetic production of organic matter was measured by the 14C tracer method. Details on the methods employed over the years are detailed in Karl et al., Progress in Oceanography ([https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2021.102563](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2021.102563)). Flow cytometry-based determinations of microbial abundances were made using an EPICS 753 flow cytometer on HOT 22-173 (December 1980 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 September 2005) and a B/D Influx flow cytometer beginning with HOT 174 . Details on the flow cytometry methods are provided at [https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/bact.html](https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/bact.html). Samples for chlorophyll a and phaeopigments were collected onto Whatman GF/F filters and extracted with 100% acetone and measured on a Turner Designs Model 10-AU fluorometer based on standard techniques described in Strickland and Parsons, 1972.

All samples were collected through the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) program, which began in 1988 with ~monthly cruises to Station ALOHA (A Long-term Oligotrophic Habitat Assessment; 22\u00c2\u00b0 10 N, 158\u00c2\u00b0 00 W). Photosynthetic production of organic matter was measured by the 14C tracer method. Details on the methods employed over the years are detailed in Karl et al., Progress in Oceanography ([https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2021.102563](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2021.102563)). Flow cytometry-based determinations of microbial abundances were made using an EPICS 753 flow cytometer on HOT 22-173 (December 1980 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 September 2005) and a B/D Influx flow cytometer beginning with HOT 174 . Details on the flow cytometry methods are provided at [https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/bact.html](https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/bact.html). Samples for chlorophyll a and phaeopigments were collected onto Whatman GF/F filters and extracted with 100% acetone and measured on a Turner Designs Model 10-AU fluorometer based on standard techniques described in Strickland and Parsons, 1972. Method details available at [https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/chl.html](https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/chl.html). Time is in a separate column from date.

            "dataset_description": "\u00e2\u0080\u009cLarge zooplankton and micronekton play important roles in the export of organic material from surface waters in the open ocean. Global Ocean Flux planning models suggest that the relationship between primary production and passive particulate export flux is strongly influenced by size structure of the zooplankton community (e.g., Paffenh\u00c3\u00b6ffer & Knowles, 1979; Small et al., 1987; Frost, 1984). Active vertical migrations also have important implications for the transport and transformation of surface-derived organic particulates to dissolved inorganic constituents at depth (Longhurst & Harrison, 1988; Longhurst et al., 1990; Al-Mutairi & Landry, 2001; Hannides et al., 2008). The zooplankton component of the time-series sampling effort allows such processes to be considered in the interpretation of seasonal and interannual variations in measured flux and the elemental mass balance (e.g., carbon and nitrogen sources and sinks) of the euphotic zone. At Station ALOHA, 6 net tows are scheduled per cruise. Three midnight (2200 - 0200) and 3 mid-day (1000 - 1400) oblique tows are done using a 1-m2 net (3-m length) with 202-\u00c2\u00b5m mesh Nitex netting. The net is towed obliquely at approximately 1 knot, from the surface to approximately 175 m and then back to the surface. Towing time is approximately 20-30 minutes. The tows are subsequently size-fractioned and analyzed for mesozooplankton wet and dry weight and C and N biomass.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rows with no depth value have been removed. Time is in local time (HST). [https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/plankton.html](https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/plankton.html)",

            "dataset_description": "\u00e2\u0080\u009cLarge zooplankton and micronekton play important roles in the export of organic material from surface waters in the open ocean. Global Ocean Flux planning models suggest that the relationship between primary production and passive particulate export flux is strongly influenced by size structure of the zooplankton community (e.g., Paffenh\u00c3\u00b6ffer & Knowles, 1979; Small et al., 1987; Frost, 1984). Active vertical migrations also have important implications for the transport and transformation of surface-derived organic particulates to dissolved inorganic constituents at depth (Longhurst & Harrison, 1988; Longhurst et al., 1990; Al-Mutairi & Landry, 2001; Hannides et al., 2008). The zooplankton component of the time-series sampling effort allows such processes to be considered in the interpretation of seasonal and interannual variations in measured flux and the elemental mass balance (e.g., carbon and nitrogen sources and sinks) of the euphotic zone. At Station ALOHA, 6 net tows are scheduled per cruise. Three midnight (2200 - 0200) and 3 mid-day (1000 - 1400) oblique tows are done using a 1-m2 net (3-m length) with 202-\u00c2\u00b5m mesh Nitex netting. The net is towed obliquely at approximately 1 knot, from the surface to approximately 175 m and then back to the surface. Towing time is approximately 20-30 minutes. The tows are subsequently size-fractioned and analyzed for mesozooplankton wet and dry weight and C and N biomass.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rows with no depth value have been removed. Time is in local time (HST). [https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/plankton.html](https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/plankton.html)",

All samples were collected through the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) program, which began in 1988 with ~monthly cruises to Station ALOHA (A Long-term Oligotrophic Habitat Assessment; 22\u00c2\u00b0 10 N, 158\u00c2\u00b0 00 W). Photosynthetic production of organic matter was measured by the 14C tracer method. Details on the methods employed over the years are detailed in Karl et al., Progress in Oceanography ([https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2021.102563](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2021.102563)). Flow cytometry-based determinations of microbial abundances were made using an EPICS 753 flow cytometer on HOT 22-173 (December 1980 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 September 2005) and a B/D Influx flow cytometer beginning with HOT 174 . Details on the flow cytometry methods are provided at [https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/bact.html](https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/bact.html). Samples for chlorophyll a and phaeopigments were collected onto Whatman GF/F filters and extracted with 100% acetone and measured on a Turner Designs Model 10-AU fluorometer based on standard techniques described in Strickland and Parsons, 1972. Method details available at [https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/chl.html](https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/chl.html). Time is in a separate column from date.

High vertical resolution environmental data are collected with a Sea-Bird CTD having external temperature (T), conductivity (C), dissolved oxygen (DO) and fluorescence (F) sensors and an internal pressure (P) sensor. A Sea-Bird 24-place carousel and an aluminum rosette that is capable of supporting 24 12-L PVC bottles are used to obtain water samples from desired depths. The CTD and rosette are deployed on a 3-conductor cable allowing for real-time display of data and for tripping the bottles at specific depths of interest. The CTD system takes 24 samples s-1 and the raw data are stored both on the computer and, for redundancy, on VHS-format video tapes. In February 2006, before cruise 178, we replaced our 24 aging 12-L PVC rosette bottles with new 12-L bottles fabricated at the University of Hawaii Engineering Support Facility, using plans and specifications from John Bullister (PMEL).\u00e2\u0080\u009d Time is in GMT.

All samples were collected through the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) program, which began in 1988 with ~monthly cruises to Station ALOHA (A Long-term Oligotrophic Habitat Assessment; 22\u00c2\u00b0 10 N, 158\u00c2\u00b0 00 W). Photosynthetic production of organic matter was measured by the 14C tracer method. Details on the methods employed over the years are detailed in Karl et al., Progress in Oceanography ([https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2021.102563](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2021.102563)). Flow cytometry-based determinations of microbial abundances were made using an EPICS 753 flow cytometer on HOT 22-173 (December 1980 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 September 2005) and a B/D Influx flow cytometer beginning with HOT 174 . Details on the flow cytometry methods are provided at [https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/bact.html](https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/bact.html). Samples for chlorophyll a and phaeopigments were collected onto Whatman GF/F filters and extracted with 100% acetone and measured on a Turner Designs Model 10-AU fluorometer based on standard techniques described in Strickland and Parsons, 1972. Method details available at [https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/chl.html](https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/chl.html). Time is in a separate column from date.

All samples were collected through the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) program, which began in 1988 with ~monthly cruises to Station ALOHA (A Long-term Oligotrophic Habitat Assessment; 22\u00c2\u00b0 10 N, 158\u00c2\u00b0 00 W). Photosynthetic production of organic matter was measured by the 14C tracer method. Details on the methods employed over the years are detailed in Karl et al., Progress in Oceanography ([https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2021.102563](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2021.102563)). Flow cytometry-based determinations of microbial abundances were made using an EPICS 753 flow cytometer on HOT 22-173 (December 1980 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 September 2005) and a B/D Influx flow cytometer beginning with HOT 174 . Details on the flow cytometry methods are provided at [https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/bact.html](https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/bact.html). Samples for chlorophyll a and phaeopigments were collected onto Whatman GF/F filters and extracted with 100% acetone and measured on a Turner Designs Model 10-AU fluorometer based on standard techniques described in Strickland and Parsons, 1972. Method details available at [https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/chl.html](https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/chl.html). Time is in a separate column from date.

High vertical resolution environmental data are collected with a Sea-Bird CTD having external temperature (T), conductivity (C), dissolved oxygen (DO) and fluorescence (F) sensors and an internal pressure (P) sensor. A Sea-Bird 24-place carousel and an aluminum rosette that is capable of supporting 24 12-L PVC bottles are used to obtain water samples from desired depths. The CTD and rosette are deployed on a 3-conductor cable allowing for real-time display of data and for tripping the bottles at specific depths of interest. The CTD system takes 24 samples s-1 and the raw data are stored both on the computer and, for redundancy, on VHS-format video tapes. In February 2006, before cruise 178, we replaced our 24 aging 12-L PVC rosette bottles with new 12-L bottles fabricated at the University of Hawaii Engineering Support Facility, using plans and specifications from John Bullister (PMEL).\u00e2\u0080\u009d Time is in GMT.

High vertical resolution environmental data are collected with a Sea-Bird CTD having external temperature (T), conductivity (C), dissolved oxygen (DO) and fluorescence (F) sensors and an internal pressure (P) sensor. A Sea-Bird 24-place carousel and an aluminum rosette that is capable of supporting 24 12-L PVC bottles are used to obtain water samples from desired depths. The CTD and rosette are deployed on a 3-conductor cable allowing for real-time display of data and for tripping the bottles at specific depths of interest. The CTD system takes 24 samples s-1 and the raw data are stored both on the computer and, for redundancy, on VHS-format video tapes. In February 2006, before cruise 178, we replaced our 24 aging 12-L PVC rosette bottles with new 12-L bottles fabricated at the University of Hawaii Engineering Support Facility, using plans and specifications from John Bullister (PMEL).\u00e2\u0080\u009d Time is in GMT.

All samples were collected through the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) program, which began in 1988 with ~monthly cruises to Station ALOHA (A Long-term Oligotrophic Habitat Assessment; 22\u00c2\u00b0 10 N, 158\u00c2\u00b0 00 W). Photosynthetic production of organic matter was measured by the 14C tracer method. Details on the methods employed over the years are detailed in Karl et al., Progress in Oceanography ([https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2021.102563](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2021.102563)). Flow cytometry-based determinations of microbial abundances were made using an EPICS 753 flow cytometer on HOT 22-173 (December 1980 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 September 2005) and a B/D Influx flow cytometer beginning with HOT 174 . Details on the flow cytometry methods are provided at [https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/bact.html](https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/bact.html). Samples for chlorophyll a and phaeopigments were collected onto Whatman GF/F filters and extracted with 100% acetone and measured on a Turner Designs Model 10-AU fluorometer based on standard techniques described in Strickland and Parsons, 1972. Method details available at [https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/chl.html](https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/chl.html). Time is in a separate column from date.

All samples were collected through the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) program, which began in 1988 with ~monthly cruises to Station ALOHA (A Long-term Oligotrophic Habitat Assessment; 22\u00c2\u00b0 10 N, 158\u00c2\u00b0 00 W). Photosynthetic production of organic matter was measured by the 14C tracer method. Details on the methods employed over the years are detailed in Karl et al., Progress in Oceanography ([https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2021.102563](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2021.102563)). Flow cytometry-based determinations of microbial abundances were made using an EPICS 753 flow cytometer on HOT 22-173 (December 1980 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 September 2005) and a B/D Influx flow cytometer beginning with HOT 174 . Details on the flow cytometry methods are provided at [https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/bact.html](https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/bact.html). Samples for chlorophyll a and phaeopigments were collected onto Whatman GF/F filters and extracted with 100% acetone and measured on a Turner Designs Model 10-AU fluorometer based on standard techniques described in Strickland and Parsons, 1972. Method details available at [https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/chl.html](https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/chl.html). Time is in a separate column from date.

High vertical resolution environmental data are collected with a Sea-Bird CTD having external temperature (T), conductivity (C), dissolved oxygen (DO) and fluorescence (F) sensors and an internal pressure (P) sensor. A Sea-Bird 24-place carousel and an aluminum rosette that is capable of supporting 24 12-L PVC bottles are used to obtain water samples from desired depths. The CTD and rosette are deployed on a 3-conductor cable allowing for real-time display of data and for tripping the bottles at specific depths of interest. The CTD system takes 24 samples s-1 and the raw data are stored both on the computer and, for redundancy, on VHS-format video tapes. In February 2006, before cruise 178, we replaced our 24 aging 12-L PVC rosette bottles with new 12-L bottles fabricated at the University of Hawaii Engineering Support Facility, using plans and specifications from John Bullister (PMEL).\u00e2\u0080\u009d Time is in GMT.

High vertical resolution environmental data are collected with a Sea-Bird CTD having external temperature (T), conductivity (C), dissolved oxygen (DO) and fluorescence (F) sensors and an internal pressure (P) sensor. A Sea-Bird 24-place carousel and an aluminum rosette that is capable of supporting 24 12-L PVC bottles are used to obtain water samples from desired depths. The CTD and rosette are deployed on a 3-conductor cable allowing for real-time display of data and for tripping the bottles at specific depths of interest. The CTD system takes 24 samples s-1 and the raw data are stored both on the computer and, for redundancy, on VHS-format video tapes. In February 2006, before cruise 178, we replaced our 24 aging 12-L PVC rosette bottles with new 12-L bottles fabricated at the University of Hawaii Engineering Support Facility, using plans and specifications from John Bullister (PMEL).\u00e2\u0080\u009d Time is in GMT.

All samples were collected through the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) program, which began in 1988 with ~monthly cruises to Station ALOHA (A Long-term Oligotrophic Habitat Assessment; 22\u00c2\u00b0 10 N, 158\u00c2\u00b0 00 W). Photosynthetic production of organic matter was measured by the 14C tracer method. Details on the methods employed over the years are detailed in Karl et al., Progress in Oceanography ([https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2021.102563](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2021.102563)). Flow cytometry-based determinations of microbial abundances were made using an EPICS 753 flow cytometer on HOT 22-173 (December 1980 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 September 2005) and a B/D Influx flow cytometer beginning with HOT 174 . Details on the flow cytometry methods are provided at [https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/bact.html](https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/bact.html). Samples for chlorophyll a and phaeopigments were collected onto Whatman GF/F filters and extracted with 100% acetone and measured on a Turner Designs Model 10-AU fluorometer based on standard techniques described in Strickland and Parsons, 1972. Method details available at [https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/chl.html](https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/chl.html). Time is in a separate column from date.

High vertical resolution environmental data are collected with a Sea-Bird CTD having external temperature (T), conductivity (C), dissolved oxygen (DO) and fluorescence (F) sensors and an internal pressure (P) sensor. A Sea-Bird 24-place carousel and an aluminum rosette that is capable of supporting 24 12-L PVC bottles are used to obtain water samples from desired depths. The CTD and rosette are deployed on a 3-conductor cable allowing for real-time display of data and for tripping the bottles at specific depths of interest. The CTD system takes 24 samples s-1 and the raw data are stored both on the computer and, for redundancy, on VHS-format video tapes. In February 2006, before cruise 178, we replaced our 24 aging 12-L PVC rosette bottles with new 12-L bottles fabricated at the University of Hawaii Engineering Support Facility, using plans and specifications from John Bullister (PMEL).\u00e2\u0080\u009d Time is in GMT.

            "dataset_description": "\u00e2\u0080\u009cLarge zooplankton and micronekton play important roles in the export of organic material from surface waters in the open ocean. Global Ocean Flux planning models suggest that the relationship between primary production and passive particulate export flux is strongly influenced by size structure of the zooplankton community (e.g., Paffenh\u00c3\u00b6ffer & Knowles, 1979; Small et al., 1987; Frost, 1984). Active vertical migrations also have important implications for the transport and transformation of surface-derived organic particulates to dissolved inorganic constituents at depth (Longhurst & Harrison, 1988; Longhurst et al., 1990; Al-Mutairi & Landry, 2001; Hannides et al., 2008). The zooplankton component of the time-series sampling effort allows such processes to be considered in the interpretation of seasonal and interannual variations in measured flux and the elemental mass balance (e.g., carbon and nitrogen sources and sinks) of the euphotic zone. At Station ALOHA, 6 net tows are scheduled per cruise. Three midnight (2200 - 0200) and 3 mid-day (1000 - 1400) oblique tows are done using a 1-m2 net (3-m length) with 202-\u00c2\u00b5m mesh Nitex netting. The net is towed obliquely at approximately 1 knot, from the surface to approximately 175 m and then back to the surface. Towing time is approximately 20-30 minutes. The tows are subsequently size-fractioned and analyzed for mesozooplankton wet and dry weight and C and N biomass.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rows with no depth value have been removed. Time is in local time (HST). [https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/plankton.html](https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/plankton.html)",

            "dataset_description": "\u00e2\u0080\u009cLarge zooplankton and micronekton play important roles in the export of organic material from surface waters in the open ocean. Global Ocean Flux planning models suggest that the relationship between primary production and passive particulate export flux is strongly influenced by size structure of the zooplankton community (e.g., Paffenh\u00c3\u00b6ffer & Knowles, 1979; Small et al., 1987; Frost, 1984). Active vertical migrations also have important implications for the transport and transformation of surface-derived organic particulates to dissolved inorganic constituents at depth (Longhurst & Harrison, 1988; Longhurst et al., 1990; Al-Mutairi & Landry, 2001; Hannides et al., 2008). The zooplankton component of the time-series sampling effort allows such processes to be considered in the interpretation of seasonal and interannual variations in measured flux and the elemental mass balance (e.g., carbon and nitrogen sources and sinks) of the euphotic zone. At Station ALOHA, 6 net tows are scheduled per cruise. Three midnight (2200 - 0200) and 3 mid-day (1000 - 1400) oblique tows are done using a 1-m2 net (3-m length) with 202-\u00c2\u00b5m mesh Nitex netting.

High vertical resolution environmental data are collected with a Sea-Bird CTD having external temperature (T), conductivity (C), dissolved oxygen (DO) and fluorescence (F) sensors and an internal pressure (P) sensor. A Sea-Bird 24-place carousel and an aluminum rosette that is capable of supporting 24 12-L PVC bottles are used to obtain water samples from desired depths. The CTD and rosette are deployed on a 3-conductor cable allowing for real-time display of data and for tripping the bottles at specific depths of interest. The CTD system takes 24 samples s-1 and the raw data are stored both on the computer and, for redundancy, on VHS-format video tapes. In February 2006, before cruise 178, we replaced our 24 aging 12-L PVC rosette bottles with new 12-L bottles fabricated at the University of Hawaii Engineering Support Facility, using plans and specifications from John Bullister (PMEL).\u00e2\u0080\u009d Time is in GMT.
