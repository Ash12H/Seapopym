    "dataset_description": "This dataset consists of measurements of photosynthetic primary production, chlorophyll a and phaeopigment concentrations, and flow cytometry-based determinations of the abundances of heterotrophic bacteria and the picophytoplankton - Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus and small eukaryotic phytoplankton. All samples were collected through the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) program, which began in 1988 with ~monthly cruises to Station ALOHA (A Long-term Oligotrophic Habitat Assessment; 22\u00c2\u00b0 10 N, 158\u00c2\u00b0 00 W). Photosynthetic production of organic matter was measured by the 14C tracer method. Details on the methods employed over the years are detailed in Karl et al., Progress in Oceanography ([https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2021.102563](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2021.102563)). Flow cytometry-based determinations of microbial abundances were made using an EPICS 753 flow cytometer on HOT 22-173 (December 1980 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 September 2005) and a B/D Influx flow cytometer beginning with HOT 174 . Details on the flow cytometry methods are provided at [https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/bact.html](https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/bact.html). Samples for chlorophyll a and phaeopigments were collected onto Whatman GF/F filters and extracted with 100% acetone and measured on a Turner Designs Model 10-AU fluorometer based on standard techniques described in Strickland and Parsons, 1972. Method details available at [https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/chl.html](https://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/methods/chl.html). Time is in a separate column from date. Dates and times are in local time (HST).",
