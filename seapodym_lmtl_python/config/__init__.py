"""
This module contains the class and functions used to manage the configuration of the model.

If you plan to use the model in a **standart way**, you should only use the `model_configuration` function.

If you want to use the model in a more **advanced way**, you can use the `FunctionParameters`, `PathParameters`,
`FunctionalGroupUnit`, `FunctionalGroups` and `Parameters` classes to manage the forcings and the parameters of the
model. In this case, you can inherit from these classes to benefit from the validation and the documentation.
